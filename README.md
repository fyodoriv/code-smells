**A curated, research-backed static-analysis tool for React/TypeScript repos.** Thin wrapper over [code-pushup](https://github.com/code-pushup/cli) with opinionated defaults — hook overload, inline props, fan-out coupling, hidden temporal coupling ([Tornhill](https://pragprog.com/titles/atevol/software-design-x-rays/)), cross-team ownership ([Nagappan 2007](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-influence-of-organizational-structure-on-software-quality-an-empirical-case-study/)), and more. Zero setup against any TS/React repo.

`cd` into the repo you want to scan, then run:

```bash
npx code-smells
```

Reports land in `./reports/report.{json,md}`. Requires Node.js 18+ and git.

### Or install globally

```bash
npm install -g code-smells
```

Worth doing if you run the tool more than occasionally:

- **Faster startup** — skips npx's package-resolution step (a few seconds saved per run; adds up in CI or across a sweep of many repos)
- **Offline after first install** — npx requires network to check the registry each run unless you pin `@x.y.z` exactly
- **Pinned version you control** — no surprise patch-version bumps the next time you run
- **Shell tab completion** works out of the box; `which code-smells` resolves
- **No `npx` prefix** — just `code-smells` from anywhere in your shell

## What you get

**Eight categories** scored 0-100, composed from **50+ audits** across **11 plugins**:

| Category | Signal |
|---|---|
| **Component Health** | Body size, cognitive complexity, hook overload, multi-component files |
| **Render Performance** | Inline props in JSX, unstable `useSelector` returns |
| **Coupling** | Import fan-out, domain-boundary violations (opt-in), hidden temporal coupling |
| **Type Safety** | TypeScript compiler diagnostics + type-coverage (inferred-any) |
| **Security & Dependencies** | npm audit vulnerabilities + outdated prod deps |
| **Accessibility** | jsx-a11y curated subset (alt text, ARIA, focus management) |
| **Test Quality** | testing-library antipatterns + function/branch/line coverage |
| **Maintainability** | Duplicated code, churn, bug-fix density, author + team dispersion, dead code |

Categories auto-adapt to target capabilities — no tsconfig skips Type Safety,
no lockfile skips Security, no lcov skips the coverage portion of Test Quality.

Output looks like this:

```
●  max-lines-per-function                    47 violations
●  react-perf/jsx-no-new-function-as-prop    89 violations
●  sonarjs/cognitive-complexity              15 violations
●  code-smells/hook-count                    12 violations
●  temporal-coupling/hidden-coupling         8 pairs (max 100% co-change)
●  team-ownership/cross-team-churn           0 files
●  jsx-a11y/alt-text                         3 violations
●  testing-library/no-container              2 violations
●  ... 40 more audits ...

## Why this vs. running ESLint directly

ESLint gives you rule-by-rule violation counts. This gives you:
- **Category scores** rolling 40+ audits into 6 top-level dials you can trend over time
- **Research-backed signals** (temporal coupling, team ownership) that no ESLint rule covers — these predict defects better than any static-analysis metric in the Nagappan 2007 study
- **Monorepo support out of the box** — auto-detects workspaces, expands tsconfig project references, gracefully degrades when plugins don't apply to a sub-workspace
- **CI ratchet** via `code-pushup compare --fail-on=regression` — fail PRs that worsen the score without cargo-culting absolute thresholds
- **Thin by design** — every audit is an existing tool (ESLint rule, maintained CLI, npm package), curated and weighted. No custom analysis engine to outgrow.

## Usage

### Single-package repo

From inside the repo:

```bash
npx code-smells
```

Defaults: `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` source glob, `src/` as the dependency-cruiser entry. Override either via env var when needed:

```bash
CP_PATTERNS='src/js/**/*.{ts,tsx}' CP_ENTRY='src/js' npx code-smells
```

### Monorepo (yarn / pnpm / npm workspaces)

Auto-detects `plugins/<ws>/src`, `libs/<ws>/src`, `packages/<ws>/src` layouts. From the monorepo root:

```bash
CP_PATTERNS='{plugins,libs,packages}/*/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}' npx code-smells
```

If the root `tsconfig.json` uses project references, they're expanded automatically into per-workspace tsconfigs for the TypeScript plugin.

### Running from elsewhere (CI, scripts)

If you can't `cd` first, point `CP_TARGET` at the repo root:

```bash
CP_TARGET=/path/to/repo npx code-smells
```

### Env vars

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CP_TARGET` | current directory | Override the repo under analysis. Useful in CI / wrappers where you can't `cd` first. |
| `CP_PATTERNS` | `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` (auto-detects workspaces in monorepos) | Glob for source files (ESLint, jsdocs, type-coverage) |
| `CP_ENTRY` | `src` (auto-detects workspaces in monorepos) | dependency-cruiser entry point(s); comma-separated list |
| `CP_TSCONFIG` | auto-detected from `references` | Explicit tsconfig path(s), comma-separated |
| `CP_COVERAGE_LCOV` | `coverage/lcov.info` if present | Path to lcov file for the coverage audit |
| `CP_ENABLE_FORMATJS` | off | Set `=true` to enable `formatjs/no-literal-string-in-jsx` (react-intl repos) |
| `CP_OUTPUT_DIR` | OS cache dir | Where reports land. Set `=./reports` to keep them inside the target repo. |
| `CP_OPEN` | off | Set `=md` or `=json` to auto-open the report after the run (macOS `open`, Linux `xdg-open`, Windows `start`). |

### Custom ESLint rules

Ships 4 rules under the `code-smells/` plugin namespace, each filling a gap where no community rule does the job:

| Rule | Flags |
|---|---|
| `hook-count` | Components with more than N total hook calls (default 10) |
| `use-effect-count` | Components with more than N `useEffect` calls (default 3) |
| `unstable-selector-returns` | `useSelector` with inline object-literal return — unstable reference, re-renders every time |
| `domain-boundaries` | **Opt-in.** Files referencing N+ distinct domain buckets. Bring your own `{ token: bucket }` map — see the [rule source](./eslint-rules/domain-boundaries.mjs) for examples |

### CI

Drop [`examples/workflows/code-smells.yml`](examples/workflows/code-smells.yml) into your repo's `.github/workflows/`. It seeds a baseline on main, compares PRs against it, posts a single sticky summary comment, and fails on category regressions.

Full setup guide in [`docs/ci-integration.md`](docs/ci-integration.md). Three [Google Tricorder](https://research.google/pubs/lessons-from-building-static-analysis-tools-at-google/) principles applied: delta over absolute thresholds, summary over per-line annotations, PR-diff-only reporting.

## Why thin is the design

Per [VISION.md](./VISION.md): value is **curation + defaults + plumbing**, not analysis logic. Every audit is an existing tool (ESLint rule, maintained CLI, npm package) wired into code-pushup's audit/category model. Justified custom code:

- ~180 lines total for the 4 custom ESLint rules — each a gap no community rule fills
- ~190 lines for `temporal-coupling` (no maintained Node tool; code-maat is JVM-based)
- ~180 lines for `team-ownership` (wraps codeowners-utils with Nagappan cross-team-commit aggregation)
- ~100 lines each for the thin plugin wrappers (`coupling`, `duplication`, `churn`, `bug-fix-density`, `author-dispersion`, `knip`, `type-coverage`)

Every custom file's JSDoc header explains **why** that specific wrapper exists — the gap it fills, what alternative was ruled out, what constraints shaped it.

## Decisions (ADRs)

- [ADR-0001](docs/decisions/0001-axe-vs-jsx-a11y.md) — use `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for accessibility; do not adopt `@code-pushup/axe-plugin`.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fyodoriv/code-smells && cd code-smells
npm install
node ./bin/code-smells.mjs  # run against cwd (the tool's own repo)
npm test                    # vitest (200+ unit tests)
npm run test:coverage       # v8 coverage, thresholds: 95% stmts/funcs/lines, 90% branches
npm run format              # prettier
```

CI runs tests + coverage on every push / PR via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
Coverage thresholds live in `vitest.config.mjs` — the build fails if any
metric drops below target.

Releases are automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action) — conventional commits on `main` accumulate into a release PR; when it merges, a GitHub release fires and `.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes to npm with [provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements). To bootstrap: add an `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret with an npm automation/granular token scoped to the `code-smells` package.

Follow-up work lives in [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md). Highlights: `tune-weights` (calibrate category weights against curated hotspots), `bundle-size-plugin`, `stylelint-plugin`, `evaluate-sonarcloud`.
